     * Let's create a reactive form which will be used in the template
     * This form is not magically available through ACL. Neither the involved
     * FormControls nor the matching template parts.
     *
     * That's why you have to do two things as a developer
     * 1) Create a binding function with autoFormBindingFactory()
     * which you can use to bind any FormGroup to ACL.
     *
     * The paths of the FormGroup like monsterMachine.monsterType will be translated
     * into an appropriate acl key "monster-type/monster-type" for all form controls.
     * Form Groups itself are ignored byt incorporated in the entire path building (like monsterMachine here).
     *
     * Once bound you can enable or disable FormControls with matching ACL rules:
     * *, monster-machine/monster-type,, edit, deny
     *
     * You can also remove the controls:
     * *, monster-machine/monster-type,, view, deny
     *
     * but for this you need to tag the template part with the identical key "monster-type/monster-type".
     * Either implicit through the aclTag hierarchy (like here in the template) or by passing the full path. In
     * both variants you need to be aware what ACL resources are created by the binding factory.
     *
     * That's the relevant code where you can see that aclTag always appears near the formGroup or formControl
     * name assignments to ensure if the control is removed (view denied) that the template is also removed. Otherwise
     * it will throw an error as the given formControl is not available anymore. Try this by remo
     * ```
     *    <div formGroupName="monsterMachine" *aclTag="'monster-machine'">
     *    <select *aclTag="'monster-type'"
     *    <input  *aclTag="'monster-name'" formControlName="monsterName"
     * ```
     *
     *
     *
     * This is a shortcoming induced by the way ReactiveForms works in two worlds (Code & Template)
     * and we have currently no way of tackling it with automation.
