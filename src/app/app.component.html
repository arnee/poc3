<h1>Weather Machine with ACL</h1>
<p>
    Imagine you are building a component you want to share. You can now
    tag various parts in the template with an acl resource name through the directive
    "*aclTag"
    acl works, you can unlock some moody emojis with your policy.
</p>

<!-- Part 1 (Template Usage & manual ACL)-->

<div *aclTag="'weather'">
    <!--
    Notice the nested usage of the aclTag here üëà üìö
    This will create ACL resource bindings in that hierarchy.
    "weather" is the parent of the folliwing list of aclTags
    so "sun", "rain" & co. are actually resources with the name
    "weather/sun", "weather/rain". This is fundamental to understand with ACL
    as we rely on the hierarchical ACL keys.

    Also note that the directive is a structural directive (see the star (*) prefix).
    This means the directive removes the content and only renders it
    when the directive code wants to do that. In this case the directive
    queries for the full ACL resource e.g. weather/sun if it can be viewed.
    If yes, add, otherwise remove.

    Tip üåü:
    Open the ACL Debugger Settings to render ACL icons that show the full ACL keys
    for everything you have tagged in the template.

    -->
    <span *aclTag="'sun'">{{sun}}</span>
    <span *aclTag="'rain'">{{rain}}</span>
    <span *aclTag="'storm'">{{storm}}</span>
    <span *aclTag="'snow'">{{snow}}</span>
    <hr>
    <div>
        Oh that's a wild weather! Would be awesome to control it, wouldn't it?
        Check the ACL Debugger if you can find the rules to reveal some magic buttons.
    </div>
    <div *aclTag="'machine'">
        <div *aclTag="'sun'">
            <button (click)="makeSun()">make sun everywhere</button>
            <div>I wonder how to go back to normal weather now? Check the ACL Debugger for a resource that could help here.</div>
        </div>

        <div *aclTag="'normal'">
            <button [disabled]="isWeatherResetDisabled$ | async" (click)="reset()">back to normal</button>
            <br>
            <span> Yes, there is the machine button. You might need to find the rule that disables it first and deactivate it.</span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<!--
Part 2 (Form Utility)
This works in combination with the `autoFormBindingFactory`
which will auto-generate bindings between ACL and FormControls
to disable/enable them (edit) or to remove them from a Form Group (view)
to remove the data from the result form data.
-->
<form [formGroup]="myMonsterForm">
    <div formGroupName="monsterMachine" *aclTag="'monster-machine'">
        <p>
            Oh there is a monster machine hidden üßö‚Äç <br>
            Everything is disabled so maybe you can unlock the fields?
        </p>

        <select *aclTag="'monster-type'" formControlName="monsterType">
            <option value="kirby">Kirby</option>
            <option value="godzilla">Godzilla</option>
            <option value="cat">Cat</option>
        </select>
        <input  *aclTag="'monster-name'" formControlName="monsterName" type="text" placeholder="Give it a cute name">

        <pre>{{myMonsterForm.value | json}}</pre>
        <div *ngIf="monsterType">
            <container-element [ngSwitch]="monsterType">
              <span *ngSwitchCase="'kirby'">
                  <img alt="Angry Kirby walking towards you" src="assets/giphy-kirby.gif">
              </span>
              <span *ngSwitchCase="'godzilla'" class="emopji" >ü¶ñ</span>
              <span *ngSwitchCase="'cat'" class="emoji">üòº</span>
              <span *ngSwitchDefault>üêï (I'm not a monster, just a placeholder)</span>
            </container-element>

            <span>My name is {{monsterName}}. Rooaar...</span>
            <p>
